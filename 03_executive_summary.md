\# Executive Summary



\## Top 5 Risks

\- R01 Account takeover via phishing (Critical)

\- R03 Ransomware via remote access (Critical)

\- R04 Backup compromise / no recovery (Critical)

\- R10 Insufficient logging \& detection (Critical)

\- R11 Weak incident response readiness (Critical)



\## Top 10 Actions (next 90 days)

1\) Enforce MFA for all + conditional access (R01/R03)

2\) Disable legacy authentication + harden email (R01/R02)

3\) Immutable/offline backups + monthly restore tests (R04)

4\) Patch baseline for endpoints + remove local admin where possible (R07)

5\) Centralize logs (at least identity/email/VPN) + basic alerting (R10)

6\) Privileged access hygiene (unique admin accounts, audit logs) (R05)

7\) Remote access hardening (VPN patching, MFA, restrictions) (R03)

8\) Laptop security baseline (BitLocker + MDM + remote wipe) (R08)

9\) Vendor security questionnaire + contract clauses (R09)

10\) Incident response plan + tabletop exercise (R11)



\## Roadmap (delivery)

\- Critical (0–90 days): A01, A02, A03, A04, A05, A09, A10

\- Next (3–6 months): A06, A07, A08, A12

\- Longer term (6–12 months): A11



\## KPIs (to track)

\- MFA coverage (%), legacy auth sign-ins (count)

\- Patch compliance (% within SLA)

\- Backup restore test success rate (%)

\- Log coverage (% critical sources ingested) + MTTD trend

\- Tabletop exercises completed (count)
