\## Scoring

\- Likelihood (L): 1–5

\- Impact (I): 1–5

\- Score = L × I (1–25)



\## Risk levels

\- 1–4: Low

\- 5–9: Medium

\- 10–14: High

\- 15–25: Critical



## Likelihood (L) – 1 to 5 scale
| Score | Label | Definition (12-month horizon) |
|------:|-------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | Rare | Very unlikely / never observed / requires an unlikely chain of events |
| 2 | Unlikely | Could happen but not expected; a few weak signals |
| 3 | Possible | Observed in the industry / plausible in the organization |
| 4 | Likely | Happens regularly; partial controls or high exposure |
| 5 | Almost certain | Happens often / active trend / high exposure + few barriers |

## Impact (I) – 1 to 5 scale
> Impact uses the worst credible case across: Financial, Operational, Legal/Compliance, Reputation.
| Score | Label | Example criteria |
|------:|-------|------------------|
| 1 | Minor | limited disruption, no downtime, low € impact, no legal obligation |
| 2 | Low | localized incident, quickly recoverable, complaint unlikely |
| 3 | Moderate | partial outage / significant delay, customer impact, possible obligations |
| 4 | Major | outage of a critical service, high financial impact, notification/audit likely |
| 5 | Critical | major disruption, severe harm (sensitive data/safety), sanctions/litigation likely |

## Risk score
- Inherent score = L × I (1–25)
- Recommended thresholds:
  - 1–4 Low
  - 5–9 Medium
  - 10–16 High
  - 17–25 Critical

## Risk appetite / decision rules (simple)
- Acceptable: Low / Medium (depending on context)
- Requires treatment: High / Critical
- Any acceptance of High/Critical must be justified and formally approved (Owner/Management).



\## Treatment options
