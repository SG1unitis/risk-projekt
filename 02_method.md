\## Scoring

\- Likelihood (L): 1–5

\- Impact (I): 1–5

\- Score = L × I (1–25)



\## Risk levels

\- 1–4: Low

\- 5–9: Medium

\- 10–14: High

\- 15–25: Critical



\## Impact scale (example)

1\. Minor: localized issue, minimal disruption

2\. Limited: short downtime or limited data exposure

3\. Major: operational disruption or sensitive data exposure

4\. Severe: multi-day disruption, regulatory impact, significant financial loss

5\. Critical: prolonged outage and/or major breach, severe business impact



\## Likelihood scale (example)

1\. Rare: strong controls, unlikely scenario

2\. Unlikely: controls exist, limited exposure

3\. Possible: common threat, partial controls

4\. Likely: clear exposure, weak controls

5\. Very likely: active exploitation, poor/no controls
